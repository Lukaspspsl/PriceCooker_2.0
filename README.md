# PriceCooker_2.0
"Give me an item and I will keep an eye on the price."

Aim: make a web app for periodical scraping of price data from an e-commerce shop.

PriceCooker is made with Flask, BeautifulSoup and some JavaScript. Data are being stored using MongoDb. It scrapes the pricetag from given urls and displays changes in a simple chart. Still in development, PriceCooker is now set to work with items from Alza.cz at first place.

PriceCooker is my first serious attempt to write and deploy a web app. Build as a part of my junior coder portfolio. The aim is to teach myself some Python and understand various dependencies and processes leading to a working app (...and reveal some ChatGPT magic along the way).
